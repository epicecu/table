## Information

The library uses modern cpp templating to allocate the correct data size during compilation. The X and Y axis data is stored as integers and the table data is stored using the templated data type.

Note: Store the axis data in a linear fashion from smallest to largest starting from the origin position. This is to ensure that interpolation can be performed between axis data points.

```

Table<data type, xSzie, ySize> 3dTable;

Table<data type, xSzie> 2dTable;

```
